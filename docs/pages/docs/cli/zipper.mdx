# yomo serve

## Usage

Zipper can be started by the following command:

```bash
yomo serve -c config.yaml
```

the `config.yaml` is a YAML file, which contains the configuration of the Zipper:

```yaml
### general ###
name: america
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 9000

### auth ###
auth:
  type: token
  token: <CREDENTIAL>

### sfn ###
functions:
  - name: sfn-ai-stream-response
  - name: sfn-async-log-events

### cascading ###
downstreams:
   - zipper-asia_pacific
     host: 2.2.2.2
     port: 9000
     auth: 'token: <CREDENTIAL>'
   - zipper-america
     host: 3.3.3.3
     port: 9000
     auth: 'token: <CREDENTIAL>'
   - zipper-europe
     host: 4.4.4.4
     port: 9000
     auth: 'token: <CREDENTIAL>'
```

## Configuration

### General Config

- `name` - the name of the Zipper, it is used to identify the Zipper in the network.
- `host` - the IP address zipper listens on, default value is `0.0.0.0`, which means listen on all network interfaces, so the [Source][source] can connect over public Internet network, while the [StreamFunction][sfn] can connect over internal network, it will be cost effective when hosting on AWS etc.
- `port` - the port zipper listens on, default value is `9000`. Becareful, YoMo uses QUIC protocol, which is a UDP based protocol, so this port should be allow UDP ingress.

### Auth Config

- `auth` - provides the credential for the Zipper, it is used to authenticate the [Source][source] and [StreamFunction][sfn] when they connect to this Zipper.
  - `type` - the type of the credential, currently only `token` is supported.
  - `token` - the credential, it is a string.

### StreamFunction Config

- `functions` - the list of [StreamFunctions][sfn] that allowed to connect this Zipper.
  - `name` - the name of the [StreamFunction][sfn], it is used to identify the [StreamFunction][sfn] in the network.

### Downstreams Config

- `downstreams` - the list of downstream Zippers, the data will be forwarded to these Zippers when needed.
  - `name` - the name of the downstream Zipper, it is used to identify the Zipper in the network.
  - `host` - the IP address of the downstream Zipper.
  - `port` - the port of the downstream Zipper.
  - `auth` - the credential to connect to the downstream Zipper.
