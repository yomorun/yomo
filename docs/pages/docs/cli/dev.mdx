# yomo dev

Developer always want elligant and fast development experience. `yomo dev` command is a shortcut for `yomo run -z dev.yomo.run:9140 -n yomo-app-demo` command. It will connect to the development zipper server and set the StreamFunction name as `yomo-app-demo` which zipper needed.

If you do not want to setup your zipper service but want to try YoMo quickly, you can use `yomo dev` command to run your StreamFunction.

## Usage 

```bash
yomo dev [flags] [/path/to/.go|.wasm|.ts]
```

## Flags

- `-f, --filename` - The StreamFunction file name, like `app.go` or `func.wasm`.
- `-m, --modfile` - Custom the `go.mod` file.

## Example

```bash
ᐅ yomo init try_yomo && cd try_yomo

ᐅ yomo dev

Press `Ctrl-C` to terminate it.

## dev.yomo.run:9140

This is a public zipper service for development, provided by YoMo Community. You can use it to test your StreamFunction. It is a free service, but we do not guarantee the stability of the service. If you want to use it in production, please [deploy your own zipper service](./zipper).

when your stream function connected to `dev.yomo.run:9140`, after authentication, this zipper services will send ingress data to your stream function every 200ms, every chunk is a string of serialized JSON object, it looks like:

```json
{"noise":34.756016,"time":1681651543820,"from":"localhost"}
```

Let's do some changes on `app.go` to inspect the `data` chunck:

```go {12} copy filename="app.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/yomorun/yomo/core/frame"
)

// Handler will handle the raw data
func Handler(data []byte) (frame.Tag, []byte) {
  fmt.Printf("sfn received %d bytes: %s\n", len(data), string(data))
	output := strings.ToUpper(string(data))
	return frame.Tag(0x34), []byte(output)
}

func DataTags() []frame.Tag {
	return []frame.Tag{0x33}
}
```

Then, execute `yomo dev` again:

```bash
ᐅ yomo dev app.go

## WebAssebly Support

You can also use `yomo dev` to run your WebAssembly StreamFunction, next, let's [build app.go to WebAssebly](./build).
