# YoMo ![Go](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

YoMo is an open-source Streaming Serverless Framework for building Low-latency Edge Computing applications. Built atop QUIC Transport Protocol and Functional Reactive Programming interface. makes real-time data processing reliable, secure, and easy.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install CLI

```bash
# Ensure use $GOPATH, golang requires main and plugin highly coupled
‚óã echo $GOPATH

‚óã GO111MODULE=off go get github.com/yomorun/yomo

‚óã cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yomorun/yomo

‚óã make install

‚óã which yomo

‚óã yomo version
yomo version 0.5.1-1-gacaf08a (2020-12-29)
```

### 2. Create your serverless app

```bash
‚óã mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME} && cd $_

‚óã yomo init yomo-app-demo
2020/12/29 13:03:57 Initializing the Serverless app...
2020/12/29 13:04:00 ‚úÖ Congratulations! You have initialized the serverless app successfully.
2020/12/29 13:04:00 üéâ You can enjoy the YoMo Serverless via the command: yomo dev

‚óã cd yomo-app-demo

```

CLI will automatically create the `app.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/yomorun/yomo/pkg/rx"
)

var printer = func(_ context.Context, i interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	value := i.(float32)
	fmt.Println("serverless get value:", value)
	return value, nil
}

// Handler will handle data in Rx way
func Handler(rxstream rx.RxStream) rx.RxStream {
	stream := rxstream.
		Y3Decoder("0x10", float32(0)).
		AuditTime(100 * time.Millisecond).
		Map(printer).
		StdOut()

	return stream
}
```

### 4. Build and run

1. Run `yomo dev` from the terminal. you will see the following message:

```bash
‚óã yomo dev
2020/12/29 13:24:01 Building the Serverless Function File...
2020/12/29 13:24:02 ‚úÖ Listening on 0.0.0.0:4242

[StdOut]:  160.75317
serverless get value: 56.65883
[StdOut]:  56.65883
serverless get value: 192.10464
[StdOut]:  192.10464
serverless get value: 75.196396
```

Congratulations! You have done your first YoMo application.

### Optional: Set $GOPATH and $GOBIN

for current session:

```bash
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

for shell: 

for `zsh` users

```bash
echo "path+=$GOPATH/bin" >> .zshrc
```

for `bash` users

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## üéØ Focuses on computings out of data center

- Latency-sensitive applications.
- Networking situation with packet loss or high latency.
- Handling continuous high frequency generated data with stream-processing.
- Building Complex systems with Streaming-Serverless architecture.

## üåü Why YoMo

- Based on QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol for data transmission, which uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its basis instead of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); significantly improves the stability and throughput of data transmission. Especially for cellular networks like 5G.
- A self-developed `yomo-codec` optimizes decoding performance. For more information, visit [its own repository](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-codec) on GitHub.
- Based on stream computing, which improves speed and accuracy when dealing with data handling and analysis; simplifies the complexity of stream-oriented programming.
- Secure-by-default from transport protocol.
