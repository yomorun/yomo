# YoMo ![Go](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

YoMo is an open-source Streaming Serverless Framework for building Low-latency Edge Computing applications. Built atop QUIC Transport Protocol and Functional Reactive Programming interface. makes real-time data processing reliable, secure, and easy.

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://gitee.com/yomorun/yomo)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install CLI

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yomorun/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Add CLI to $PATH

for current session:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.yomo
```

for `zsh` users

```bash
echo "path+=~/.yomo" >> .zshrc
```

for `bash` users

```bash
echo 'export PATH="~/.yomo:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Create your serverless app

```bash
yomo init yomo-demo && cd $_
```

You will see the following message:

```bash
(10:20:26 ~/Downloads)‚îÄ‚îÄ> yomo init yomo-demo && cd $_
2020/12/25 10:20:26 ‚úÖ Congratulations! You have initialized the serverless app successfully.
2020/12/25 10:20:26 üéâ You can enjoy the YoMo Serverless via the command: yomo dev
```

CLI will automatically create the `app.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/yomorun/yomo/pkg/rx"
)

var printer = func(_ context.Context, i interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	value := i.(float32)
	fmt.Println("serverless get value:", value)
	return value, nil
}

// Handler will handle data in Rx way
func Handler(rxstream rx.RxStream) rx.RxStream {
	stream := rxstream.
		Y3Decoder("0x10", float32(0)).
		AuditTime(100 * time.Millisecond).
		Map(printer).
		StdOut()

	return stream
}
```

### 4. Build and run

1. Run `yomo dev` from the terminal. you will see the following message:

```bash
(10:21:48 ~/yomo-demo)‚îÄ‚îÄ> yomo dev
2020/12/25 10:21:48 Building the Serverless Function File...
2020/12/25 10:21:49 ‚úÖ Listening on 0.0.0.0:4242
serverless get value: 81.24497
[StdOut]:  81.24497
serverless get value: 100.879654
[StdOut]:  100.879654
```

Congratulations! You have done your first YoMo application.

## üéØ Focuses on computings out of data center

- Latency-sensitive applications.
- Networking situation with packet loss or high latency.
- Handling continuous high frequency generated data with stream-processing.
- Building Complex systems with Streaming-Serverless architecture.

## üåü Why YoMo

- Based on QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol for data transmission, which uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its basis instead of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); significantly improves the stability and throughput of data transmission. Especially for cellular networks like 5G.
- A self-developed `yomo-codec` optimizes decoding performance. For more information, visit [its own repository](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-codec) on GitHub.
- Based on stream computing, which improves speed and accuracy when dealing with data handling and analysis; simplifies the complexity of stream-oriented programming.
- Secure-by-default from transport protocol.
