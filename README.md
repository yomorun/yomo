# YoMo ![Go](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/workflows/Go/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/yomorun/yomo/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=MHCE5TZWKM)](https://codecov.io/gh/yomorun/yomo) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/770589787404369930.svg?label=discord&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2)](https://discord.gg/RMtNhx7vds)

YoMo is an open-source LLM Function Calling Framework for building scalable and ultra-Fast AI Agents.

üíö We care about: **Empowering Exceptional Customer Experiences in the Age of AI**

We believe that seamless and responsive AI interactions are key to delivering outstanding customer experiences. YoMo is built with this principle at its core, focusing on speed, reliability, and scalability.


## üå∂ Features

|    | **Features** |    |
| -- | ------------ | -- |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è | **Low-Latency MCP** | Guaranteed by implementing atop the [QUIC Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/documents/). Experience significantly faster communication between AI agents and MCP server. |
| üîê  | **Enhanced Security** | TLS v1.3 encryption is applied to every data packet by design, ensuring robust security for your AI agent communications. |
| üöÄ  | **Strongly-Typed Language** | Build robust AI agents with complete confidence through type-safe function calling, enhanced error detection, and seamless integration capabilities. Type safety prevents runtime errors, simplifies testing, and enables IDE auto-completion. Currently support TypeScript and Go. |
| üì∏  | **Effortless Serverless DevOps** | Streamline the entire lifecycle of your LLM tools, from development to deployment. Significantly reduces operational overhead, allowing you to focus exclusively on creating innovative AI agent functionalities. |
| üåé  | **Geo-Distributed Architecture** | Bring AI inference and tools closer to your users with our globally distributed architecture, resulting in significantly faster response times and a superior user experience for your AI agents. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Let's build a simple AI agent with LLM Function Calling to provide weather information:

### Step 1. Install CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.yomo.run | sh
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
yomo version
```

### Step 2. Start the server

Create a configuration file `my-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-agent
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 9000

auth:
  type: token
  token: SECRET_TOKEN

bridge:
  ai:
    server:
      addr: 0.0.0.0:9000 ## OpenAI API compitable endpoint
      provider: vllm     ## llm to use

    providers:
      vllm:
        api_endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
        model: meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct

      ollama:
        api_endpoint: http://localhost:11434
```

Launch the server:

```sh
yomo serve -c my-agent.yaml
```

### Step 3. Implement the LLM Function Calling

Create a type-safe function that grounding weather data:

```typescript
export const description = 'Get the current weather for `city`'

export type Argument = {
  /**
   * The name of the city to be queried
   */
  city: string;
}

export async function handler(args: Argument) {
  // Simulate a weather API call
  let tempraure = Math.floor(Math.random() * 41)
  // Return the result to LLM
  return { 
    city: args.city, 
    temperature: tempraure,
    feels_like: 11.9,
    rain: false,
  }
}
```

Finished, now, let's run it:

```bash
$ yomo run -n get-weather
```

### Done, let's have a try

```sh
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer SECRET_TOKEN" \
-d '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I am going for a hike on the Yarra Bend Park Loop. What should I wear?"
    }
  ],
  "stream": false
}'
```

You'll receive a helpful response like this:

```
For your hike on the Yarra Bend Park Loop, the current weather is clear with a temperature of approximately 12.3¬∞C (feels like 11.9¬∞C). 

Here are some suggestions on what to wear: 

1. **Layers**: Start with a base layer such as a moisture-wicking t-shirt. Add a light sweater or fleece for warmth since it can be chilly. 
2. **Jacket**: Bring a lightweight jacket or windbreaker to keep warm, especially as it is breezy with a southeast wind at 6 km/h with gusts up to 14 km/h. 
3. **Pants**: Comfortable hiking pants or leggings will be suitable. 
4. **Footwear**: Wear sturdy hiking boots or shoes with good grip. 
5. **Accessories**: Consider a hat or beanie for warmth, and bring gloves if you tend to get cold easily. 
6. **Backpack**: Carry a small backpack with water, snacks, and any additional layers you might need. 

Since there is **no rain** expected, you shouldn't need waterproof gear, but it's always wise to check the latest forecast before heading out. Enjoy your hike!

## üéØ Focuses on Geo-distributed AI Inference Infra

It‚Äôs no secret that today‚Äôs users want instant AI inference, every AI 
application is more powerful when it response quickly. But, currently, when we
talk about `distribution`, it represents **distribution in data center**. The AI model is
far away from their users from all over the world.

If an application can be deployed anywhere close to their end users, solve the
problem, this is **Geo-distributed System Architecture**:
