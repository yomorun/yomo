# YoMo ![Go](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo/workflows/Go/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/yomorun/yomo/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=MHCE5TZWKM)](https://codecov.io/gh/yomorun/yomo) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/770589787404369930.svg?label=discord&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2)](https://discord.gg/RMtNhx7vds)

YoMo is an open-source Streaming Serverless Framework for building Low-latency
Edge Computing applications. Built atop QUIC Transport Protocol and Functional
Reactive Programming interface, it makes real-time data processing reliable,
secure, and easy.

Official Website: ü¶ñ[https://yomo.run](https://yomo.run)

üíö We care about: **The Demand For Real-Time Digital User Experiences**

It‚Äôs no secret that today‚Äôs users want instant gratification, every productivity
application is more powerful when it's collaborative. But, currently, when we
talk about `distribution`, it represents **distribution in data center**. API is
far away from their users from all over the world.

If an application can be deployed anywhere close to their end users, solve the
problem, this is **Geo-distributed System Architecture**:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisite

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Step 1. Install CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.yomo.run | sh
```

Verify if the CLI was installed successfully

```bash
yomo version
```

### Step 2. Init your first stream function, in WebAssembly way

In this demo, we will create a go project observing a data stream and count
bytes received.

```bash
yomo init try-yomo
```

The yomo CLI will generate codes in folder `try-yomo`.

### Step 3. Build

This Stream Function is written in Go, before compiling to WebAssembly, you need
to install [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) first.

```bash
$ yomo build --target wasm app.go

‚ÑπÔ∏è YoMo Stream Function file: app.go
‚åõ YoMo Stream Function building...
‚úÖ Success! YoMo Stream Function build.
```

Now, we get the `sfn.wasm` file, only 190K bytes.

```bash
$ exa -l
.rw-r--r--  359 fanweixiao 14 Apr 01:02 app.go
.rwxr-xr-x 190k fanweixiao 14 Apr 01:08 sfn.wasm
```

> Note: you can implement Stream Function in Rust, Zig, C or other languages can
> be compiled to WebAssembly, more examples can be found at
> [example/7-wasm/sfn](example/7-wasm/sfn).

### Step 4. Run

There is an public test Zipper service `tap.yomo.dev:9140` which is provided by
our community, you can test your StreamFunction quickly by connecting to it.

```bash
$ yomo run -z tap.yomo.dev:9140 -n yomo-app-demo sfn.wasm

‚ÑπÔ∏è YoMo Stream Function file: sfn.wasm
‚åõ  Create YoMo Stream Function instance...
‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting YoMo Stream Function instance with executable file: sfn.wasm. Zipper: [tap.yomo.dev:9140].
‚ÑπÔ∏è YoMo Stream Function is running...
time=2023-04-14T00:05:25.073+08:00 level=INFO msg="use credential" component="Stream Function" client_id=7IwpRofCpPp-AcVV2qUFc client_name=yomo-app-demo credential_name=none
time=2023-04-14T00:05:26.297+08:00 level=INFO msg="connected to zipper" component="Stream Function" client_id=7IwpRofCpPp-AcVV2qUFc client_name=yomo-app-demo zipper_addr=tap.yomo.dev:9140
sfn received 57 bytes
sfn received 59 bytes
sfn received 59 bytes
sfn received 59 bytes
sfn received 58 bytes
sfn received 59 bytes
sfn received 58 bytes
sfn received 59 bytes
sfn received 58 bytes
^C
```

It works!

> Note: `yomo dev sfn.wasm` is more convinient for development, it will connect
> to `tap.yomo.dev:9140` automatically.

## üéØ Focuses on computings out of data center

- IoT/IIoT/AIoT
- Latency-sensitive applications.
- Networking situation with packet loss or high latency.
- Handling continuous high frequency generated data with stream-processing.
- Building Complex systems with Streaming-Serverless architecture.

## üåü Why YoMo

- Based on QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol for data transmission,
  which uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its basis instead of the
  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); significantly improves the stability and
  throughput of data transmission. Especially for cellular networks like 5G.
- A self-developed `y3-codec` optimizes decoding performance. For more
  information, visit [its own repository](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec)
  on GitHub.
- Based on stream computing, which improves speed and accuracy when dealing with
  data handling and analysis; simplifies the complexity of stream-oriented
  programming.
- Secure-by-default from transport protocol.
