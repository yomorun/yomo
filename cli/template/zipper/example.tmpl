### Example

Typically, to run a zipper from a host, it is necessary to create a `zipper.yml` file. The basic content is as follows:

```yaml
name: zipper 
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 9000

bridge:
  # mcp server
  mcp:
    server:
      addr: localhost:9001
  # chat completion api server
  ai:
    server:
      addr: localhost:8000
      provider: ollama

    providers:
      ollama:
        api_endpoint: http://localhost:11434
```

then run zipper using the `yomo serve` command as follows:

```bash
yomo serve -c zipper.yml
```
